       <h1>A Happy Day</h1>

      <div class="para">
        <p>Eid has always been a part of me for the 16 years that I have lived, and it is always my happiest time. Every year I look forward to Eid, both Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha. Eid-ul-Adha, the Festival of Sacrifice, is when we sacrifice a cow or goat in a specific way, and share the meat withto people around us and to those in need. Eid-ul-Fitr is the happy day that comes after Ramadan, the month of fasting. To me Eid-ul-Fitr feels like a reward for keeping all 29 or 30 fasts, and not cheating during it. This is because that entire month I don’t eat a lot, so I make it up that day by eating to the max capacity of my stomach. By the way, all that food isn’t from home, but from all the houses my family visited during Eid. Eid has always been like that. Whether it’s here now in Manhattan or back in Dhaka, Bangladesh then. We celebrate it together as a community; we share the joy.
        </p>
        <p>Unlike before, Eid this year was very different and I was more grateful for Ramadan than other years. 2020 is such an appalling year: locked at home for three3 months straight, worried about my loved ones, disoriented from the blaring news of covid, grieved for the death of those around me. There is so much to say about 2020, and especially in the first month of quarantine was just the worst. The feeling of isolation, confinement, anxiety, and uncertainty gnawed at me. Being at home for so long when we weren’t used to it, made us irritated and short tempered. Then Ramadan came. The month of blessings, giving, peace and prayer. This month made me feel safe from what was going on outside. I could relax. Ramadan is something that we are certain of in this time of uncertainty. We started to follow a routine, similar to before quarantine. Ramadan gave my family something to think about together and allowed us to bond, because we spent lots of time together. Not just our family, but also our neighbors we used to talk so much to. We started to call them. Together we put so much faith into Ramadan, and with all our hearts hoped that things would get better after Ramadan, and looked forward to Eid.
        </p>
        <p>We try to replicate Eid in Manhattan like it is in Bangladesh. But Eid in Manhattan, in my neighborhood, is different and special to me. First off the community of bangali muslims we created is small. There are eight8 families, ninenhi.9 including my family. Secondly, all of these families are very close to each other. Like six6 of the families are one block apart, and lastly we all live in apartments, so we have similar constraints on what we can make (Bangali people really like pungent smelling food). To me my neighborhood is outlined by the outskirts of these families, because we go to them so often. Here we made a community interchanging of bangali culture. Here we enjoy Eid by making a schedule to go to peoples houses, here we don’t invite people over but go with people together. Because of this community that we build on the fact that we are bengali muslims. What is most surprising about Eid is that other people, besides the known community, join in, muslims or not. This is what I think of NYC.
